This repository aims to make publically available the data of Nasioulas et al. 2024. 
The data are included in the .csv file (Nasioulas2024_data.csv) and the related .txt file (Nasioulas2024_data_readMe.txt) provides information about the columns of the data matrix. 

A simple Matlab script (Nasioulas2024_basicFigures.m) is provided to facilitate the reader to reproduce the basic plots of our manuscript. 
To keep the codes simple, the violin plots of the manuscript are substituted here by the simpler boxplots -but the essence remains the same.

Examples of figures created by this script are given in .jpg files.
